title: A species is priceless - does that mean that it is worth nothing or everything?

<p>Richard Conniff﻿ has an <a href="http://e360.yale.edu/feature/what_are_species_worth_putting_a_price_on_biodiversity/2322/">eloquent piece</a> up at <em>Yale Environment 360</em> discussing how we place economic value on species and biodiversity in general.&nbsp;&nbsp; He tells the story of how farmers in India inadverdantly killed 99% of the country's vultures by feeding their cattle anti-inflamatory drugs.&nbsp; The drugs caused renal failure in vultures feeding on the carcasses.&nbsp; With the vultures gone, India's feral dog population skyrocketed, and the feral dogs gave many people rabies.&nbsp; The loss of vultures is estimated to have cost the country at least $24 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This story illustrates how species matter, but it also shows us mind-bogglingly complex and unpredictable ecosystems can be.&nbsp; Could anyone have anticipated the cost of losing India's vultures?&nbsp; (Or the numerous other <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2554668/">examples</a> we have of cascading effects of species loss?) Bryan Norton <a href="http://www.ciesin.org/docs/002-256b/002-256b.html">used this metaphor to describe our ignorance</a> and argue against the idea of placing dollar values on species:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been in a terrible accident, and I wake up in a hospital bed on a lifesupport system. The hospital is short on funds, and the hospital administrators are having a meeting at my bedside. They say they have examined all the other methods to raise the necessary money, and they are proposing to sell a few spare parts from my life-support system at a yard sale. One of them says, "This equipment is so complicated, a few parts won't be missed." "How much do you think this part is worth?" asks another, pointing toward a piece of shiny metal. I try to see what the part is connected to, but it is screwed into a big metal box that looks important. "Or that one over there; it looks like it's just cosmetic," another of them suggests. I almost agree, and then I notice that a main power line passes through it. "Stop! Not that one," I say. Just in time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Norton concludes, "The value of biodiversity is the value of everything there is."&nbsp; I agree philosophically.&nbsp; Practically, though, I draw a different conclusion.&nbsp; We need to move away from species-centric valuation, and find ways to make economic decisions based on aggregate measures of ecosystem health and stability.&nbsp; This, of course, will open a whole other can of worms (How to we measure it?&nbsp; Who is responsible for it?), but I think the whole-system perspective will serve us better.</p>
