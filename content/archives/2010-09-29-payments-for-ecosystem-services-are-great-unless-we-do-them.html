title: Payments for ecosystem services are great, unless we do them enough to make a difference

<p>The usually excellent Mongabay ran the scare headline, "<a href="http://news.mongabay.com/2010/0927-hance_tcs_pes.html">Could industrial interests ruin payments for environmental services?</a>" on a piece in <em>Tropical Conservation Science</em>.&nbsp; Thankfully the authors of the paper being reported on, "<a href="http://tropicalconservationscience.mongabay.com/content/v3/10-09-27_249-261_Pirard_et_al.pdf">Upscaling Payments for Environmental Services (PES): Critical issues</a>" are a little less alarmist.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I think that that their concern about large companies getting involved in ecosystem service markets is overwrought.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PES have traditionally been conceived and applied in contexts where the providers of the service are populations (as opposed to industrial companies) &ndash; fishermen, farmers, forest dwellers....the compensation paid to the commercial sector benefiting from rights granted by society (government or local authorities) is at best questionable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a narrow and somewhat naive perspective. The <a href="http://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/pages/dynamic/article.page.php?page_id=5917&amp;section=home&amp;eod=1">largest PES markets</a> are government mandated and mediated programs in the developed world, such as the&nbsp; U.S.'s Conservation Reserve Program.&nbsp; The recipients of PES in these cases are mostly large-scale landowners with industrial-size operations, and more recently wetland and habitat bankers.&nbsp; These actors are essential to getting PES to a scale where it can make a real difference.</p>
<p>The authors do make some good points as to issues that need to get worked out, though, particularly with large-scale international carbon trading through REDD programs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concessions on public lands</strong> - Companies are extracting PES out of public lands on which they have been granted logging rights or other leases.&nbsp; Countries need to clarify what rights they retain to land they lease.&nbsp; It would be best international bodies that set standards for carbon trading, set limits on the types of concessions that companies can use to generate income from PES.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong>Polluter pays</strong> - It has been a long standing pillar of environmental policies that the polluter should pay the cost of their environmental degradation.&nbsp;&nbsp;PES somewhat flips this idea on its head when landowners are paid to <em>not</em> damage the environment.&nbsp; In purely economic terms, there should be no difference - a landowner is loosing money by foresaking this income.&nbsp;&nbsp; The real problem is one of access - the programs will be more efficient and equitable if they are scaled up and widely accessible.</li>
<li><strong>"Use Restricting" vs. "Asset Building" PES</strong> - The authors draw a distinction between "use restricting" payments that merely prevent environmental degradation and "asset building" programs that explicitly use PES to drive sustainable development.&nbsp; It's an interesting contrast, but two thoughts come to mind.&nbsp; First, sustainable development aid needs broader and better funding sources than PES, which are probably too restrictive for real holistic development programs.&nbsp; Second, this dichotomy ignores a broad spectrum of in-between possibilities that would be ideal for private sector involvement, particularly large scale restoration programs.</li>
</ul>
