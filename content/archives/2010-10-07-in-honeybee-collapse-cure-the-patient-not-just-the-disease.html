title: In honeybee collapse, cure the patient, not just the disease.

<p>My <a href="http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2007/03/05/what-silent-spring-means-business-risk">first published article</a> examined implications of the massive collapse of honeybee populations on business, so I feel compelled to comment on the latest development in the hunt for the cause of colony collapse disorder (CCD).</p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0013181;jsessionid=DCA25DEC6735B7A5A8AC0A1AD9189DD1.ambra01">new article</a> out on the subject by a team led by University of Montana researchers and the US Army Chemical Biological center.&nbsp; Using proteomic sequencing, they found two culprits in the bodies of dead bees: invertebrate iridescent virus (IIV), a long-stranded DNA virus, and <em>Nosema, </em>a fungal spore.&nbsp; Both had been detected in bees found dead of CCD before, but here they showed that affected bees were most likely to have both pathogens working in concert.</p>
<p>It's an encouraging development.&nbsp; However, I'd like to point out that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/science/07bees.html">news coverage</a> that emphasizes the "we found it!" narrative misses the important lessons that have come out of the CCD experience.&nbsp; Previous researchers <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/327/5962/152">had predicted</a> that the cause of CCD would not likely be a new pathogen but a combination of interacting effects, and pointed out that the rise of highly technical, industrialized monoculture beekeeping in the U.S. had left bee-pollinated agriculture vulnerable to new combinations such as these.&nbsp;&nbsp; The effects of pesticides, stress, and the mass trucking of bee populations around the country are still unknown but likely exacerbate the effects of pests, new and old.</p>
<p>If we can protect bees from IIV and <em>Nosema</em>, great.&nbsp; However, it is just as important to build resilience and diversity into our agricultural system so as to reduce the risks associated with unknown future diseases.&nbsp; Otherwise we will be unprepared for the next CCD that will inevitably come.</p>
