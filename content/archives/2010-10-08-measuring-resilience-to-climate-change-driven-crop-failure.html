title: Measuring resilience to climate-change driven crop failure

<p><span>A number of news outlets have picked up on a <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/5/3/034012/pdf/1748-9326_5_3_034012.pdf">new article</a> in Environmental Research Letters by Andy Challinor and a team at the University at Leeds.&nbsp; The standard headline is "<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-10-07/crop-failures-to-increase-on-climate-change-researchers-say.html">Crop Failures to Increase With Climate Change</a>," but I think the much more interesting part of the research is the author's creation of a vulnerability index based on the historical crop data in China.&nbsp; Essentially, they looked at periods of drought in the past, and examined how well farmers were able to mitigate the drought's effects through additional labor or technology: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>A high vulnerability index identiﬁes years and/or regions where the yield loss was large relative to the size of the drought. A low value of VI indicates that the efﬁcacy of the socio-economic adaptation to drought is high, for example due to good water management, increasing fertilizer, per capita investments in agriculture, and falling numbers of rural households.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>The authors point out that investment in resilience and adaptation is most important in areas where high vulnerabilities were found and where crop failures are most likely.&nbsp; Also, interestingly, they note that while vulnerability generally goes down with increasing GDP, this doesn't apply in all cases.&nbsp; Investments specific to adaptive capacity may be more effective than an indiscriminate focus on economic growth.</span></p>
