<p>In Wasior, Papua New Guinea, flash floods have <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/10/11/indonesia.flooding/">killed well over 100 people</a>.&nbsp; Conservation groups <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/10/09/wasior-flood-blamed-deforestation.html">blame illegal logging activities</a> in the Wasior area for exacerbating the flooding, and the Indonesian government is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE69A1GS20101011">investigating this possibility.</a></p>
<p>While this case is still uncertain, it is clear that deforestation leads to increased flood risk.&nbsp; CJA Bradshaw and colleagues published an <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01446.x/abstract">article</a> in Global Change Biology showing that at 10% increase in deforestation leads to a 4%-28% increase in flood frequencies in developing countries.&nbsp; (See <a href="http://conservationbytes.com/2008/08/20/native-forests-reduce-the-risk-of-catastrophic-floods/">his own blog</a> for more details on the science.)</p>
<p>My question is: How far does liability for the flood damage extend?&nbsp; If logging can be shown to bear the blame for this or other disasters, can those who benefit from the logging be sued?&nbsp; They have, in essence, stolen locals' ecosystem services.</p>
<p>This isn't a theoretical question.&nbsp; The legal infrastructure tying manufacturers of wood products to forest damages is being assembled.&nbsp; In the U.S.,&nbsp; 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act banned commerce in illegally harvested the U.S.&nbsp; Last year, Gibson Guitar's Nashville factory <a href="http://nashville.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2009/11/16/daily25.html">was raided</a> by federal agents for using wood from illegal sources.&nbsp; (WRI has a <a href="http://www.wri.org/stories/2010/10/declarations-and-due-care-insights-another-lacey-case">write-up</a> for supply chain managers the Lacey Act.)</p>
<p>With law enforcement pursuing cases like this, evidence will be assembled tying manufacturers all the way back to forests.&nbsp;&nbsp; When science links forests to ecosystem services such as carbon storage and flood control,&nbsp; and markets put explicit values on these ecosystem functions, companies may find themselves responsible for a whole new set of damages.&nbsp;</p>
