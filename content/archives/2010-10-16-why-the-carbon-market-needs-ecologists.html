<p>Last week the Journal of Applied Ecology had an article titled, "<a href="http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01885.x">How can ecologists help realize the potential of payments for carbon in tropical forest countries?</a>" It outlined ways that ecologists could make themselves useful in Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD).&nbsp; The article was aimed at ecologists, but I'm going to give the authors' insights a different twist.&nbsp; In the interest of the welfare of my colleagues, I'd like to point out to the carbon community that ecological expertise is worth some money.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Ecologists can develop more accurate forecasts - </strong></em>The authors document a case in Peru where project developers overestimated the carbon credits they could generate by 15%.&nbsp; Ecologists, by taking into account the regions' drought history, were able to make a more credible and accurate prediction, allowing the developers to make a better investment decision.&nbsp; (Based on <a href="http://moderncms.ecosystemmarketplace.com/repository/moderncms_documents/SFCM_2009_smaller.pdf">Ecosystem Marketplace's data</a>, I roughly estimate this made $100,000 difference)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Ecologists can find cheaper monitoring methods - </strong></em>Set up and monitoring can comprise 40% of project costs.&nbsp; At one Amazonian site, much of forest degradation was the result of poaching palm fruits, which killed female trees.&nbsp; Ecologists figured out that the level of poaching could me measured by comparing the ratio of male to female trees, easily done with little training during flowering season.&nbsp; This method is considerably cheaper (and safer), than surveilling for poaching activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>See?&nbsp; Project developers, hire an ecologist.&nbsp; I recommend those trained at <a href="http://ecology.ucdavis.edu/">UC Davis</a> or <a href="http://envstudies.brown.edu/">Brown University.</a></p>
