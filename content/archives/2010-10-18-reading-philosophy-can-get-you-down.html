<p>Reading Lawrence Hinman's "Ethics, a Pluralistic Approach to Moral Theory," I came across this quote in a discussion of valuing utility to future generations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...they do not yet exist - and, depending on our actions, they may never exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I stared at this for a long time.</p>
