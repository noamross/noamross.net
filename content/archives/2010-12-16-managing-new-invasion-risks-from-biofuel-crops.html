<p>A particularly worrisome area of risk associated with biofuel crops is the possibility that the crops themselves may become noxious pests in countries to which they are imported.&nbsp; In the current issue of <em>Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment</em>, Adam Davis et al. <a href="http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/090030">review</a> what is known about such invasions and how to manage them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biofuel crops are likely to invade ecosystems because many of the traits that make them attractive to grow&nbsp;(fast growth, low resource requirements, adaptable to many environments) are exactly those that help them out-compete native plants.&nbsp;&nbsp; Woody species introduced as fuel crops in Africa in the Middle east have caused ecological damage.&nbsp; In the U.S., Giant Cane (<em>Arundo donax</em>) has invaded and choked off streams and wetlands, and is all but impossible to eradicate once established,&nbsp;yet it is actively promoted as a fuel crop in the Gulf States.</p>
<p>The authors point out that systems to identify plants as possible invaders exist.&nbsp; Australia's Weed Risk Assessment System (WRA), for instance, has had 95% success in predicting species likely to become damaging invaders by evaluating them on whether they exhibit a series of weed-like ecological traits.&nbsp; However, a 95% success rate still means that 1 in 20 plants introduced can become harmful invaders, and far more than 20 plant species are being evaluated by entrepeneurs and researchers as candidates for new biofuel feedstocks.&nbsp; Given the amount of ecological data required, achieving a better success rate such as 99% from such systems is unlikely.</p>
<p>How then should we manage the risk of invaders while searching for new crops?&nbsp; The authors suggest a two-tiered system, where plants passing a checklist-based system like the&nbsp;WRA are then&nbsp;subjected to experimental plantings to determine if they can thrive in the absence of any human cultivation.&nbsp; More stringent criteria are given for those plants for which little current data exists on invasive traits.&nbsp; The "nested-seive" approach has a much lower likelihood of letting potential invaders through.</p>
