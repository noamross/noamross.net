<p>In SEED Magazine, theoretical biologist George Sugihara <a href="http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/on_early_warning_signs/">writes</a> about early warning signals for collapses in complex systems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A key phenomenon known for decades is so-called &ldquo;critical slowing&rdquo; as a threshold approaches. That is, a system&rsquo;s dynamic response to external perturbations becomes more sluggish near tipping points. Mathematically, this property gives rise to increased inertia in the ups and downs of things like temperature or population numbers&mdash;we call this inertia &ldquo;autocorrelation&rdquo;&mdash;which in turn can result in larger swings, or more volatility....Another related early signaling behavior is an increase in &ldquo;spatial resonance&rdquo;: Pulses occurring in neighboring parts of the web become synchronized. Nearby brain cells fire in unison minutes to hours prior to an epileptic seizure, for example, and global financial markets pulse together. The autocorrelation that comes from critical slowing has been shown to be a particularly good indicator of certain geologic climate-change events, such as the greenhouse-icehouse transition that occurred 34 million years ago; the inertial effect of climate-system slowing built up gradually over millions of years, suddenly ending in a rapid shift that turned a fully lush, green planet into one with polar regions blanketed in ice.</p>

<p>I've been meaning to write more about early warning signals. &nbsp; My current project involves hunting for these signals in satellite data of forest ecosystems. &nbsp;In theory, such signals could forecast a die-off from drought, or a pest outbreak.</p>
