<p>WRI continues the march of environmentally-driven <a href="http://www.noamross.net/blog/2010/12/6/good-environmental-management-lowers-cost-of-borrowing.html">credit</a> <a href="http://www.noamross.net/blog/2010/10/21/new-approaches-to-looking-at-water-related-financial-risks.html">analyses</a>&nbsp;with a <a href="http://www.wri.org/publication/how-us-federal-climate-policy-could-affect-chemicals-credit-risk">new report on the chemical sector</a> and how climate regulation could effect industry's ability to borrow. &nbsp;WRI looks at both congressionally- and EPA-driven scenarios for greenhouse gas regulation and maps how different chemical sub-sectors will be affected in each.</p>

<p>Differences between cap-and-trade legislation and EPA-implemented regulation are interesting and not entirely intuitive. &nbsp;For instance, based on previous attempts at cap-and-trade, legislation will probably provide free emissions permits to emissions-intense sectors for the first decade or so, leaving&nbsp;<em>medium</em>&nbsp;emitters the most exposed. &nbsp; Also, legislation will probably give companies more flexibility, allowing them to choose whether to purchase permits or invest capital into efficiency. &nbsp;However, implementation of EPA regulations will probably be simpler, as participating in the rading markets under cap-and-trade will require more sophistication and mangement across the business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, the fertilizer industry has high potential exposure in both, as it cap-and-trade could increase the price of its large energy purchases, and its N<span style="vertical-align: sub;">2</span>O emissions are an easy target for regulatory limits. &nbsp;</p>
