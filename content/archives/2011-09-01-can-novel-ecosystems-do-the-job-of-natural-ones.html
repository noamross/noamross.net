<div id="_mcePaste">This week in <em>Science</em>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v477/n7362/full/477029a.html">Shahid Naeem reviews two books</a>&nbsp;(paywall) about modern, "novel" ecosystems, which humans have created by mixing together species that never evolved together. &nbsp;He wonders, are such systems Frankensteins?</div>
<blockquote>
<div>Modern ecosystems that are haphazardly&nbsp;assembled from the remains of human&nbsp;development are unpredictable and fragile. With one billion people hungry, two&nbsp;billion poor and three billion in desperate need of water, the hopes of humanity rest on conserving, restoring and&nbsp;sustainably managing the services that&nbsp;nature provides. The bigger question is&nbsp;whether the unnatural nature that we&nbsp;have wrought, although familiar in form&nbsp;and function, will save us or prove to be&nbsp;monstrous.</div>
