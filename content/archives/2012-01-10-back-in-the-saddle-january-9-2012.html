<h1>Letter</h1>

<ul>
<li>Submitted public university funding letter to <em>Frontiers in Ecology and Environement</em>.  Follow up in a week.January 9, 2012  </li>
</ul>

<h1>Warning signals</h1>

<ul>
<li>Read <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12080-011-0149-6">Bel et. al. (2012) "Gradual regime shifts in spatially extended ecosystems."</a> and discussed with Carl.  Interesting.  Shows a simple model of transition between spotted spatial patterning and uniform landscapes, describes the "snaking" bifurcation pattern between the two.  Might be applicable to pollen stuff below.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Pollen</h1>

<ul>
<li>Read <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01810.x">Williams et. al. (2010), "Rapid responses of the prairie-forest ecotone to early Holocene aridity in mid-continental North America."</a>  Looks like a good paper to use to select pollen datasets from.  %AP (arboreal pollen) might be the appropriate response variable here.</li>
<li>Messed around the <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/napd.html">North American Pollen Database (NAPD)</a> trying to understand its structure.  At first everything seemed to be in an old Paradox database format, but downloaded the raw ASCII files via <a href="ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/paleo/pollen/">their FTP</a></li>
<li>Found the "stratiagraph" R package for working with NAPD files.  Should use it tomorrow to extract the Williams sites and calculate %AP across them.  </li>
<li>New <a href="https://github.com/noamross/Pollen">gitub repository</a> for this work (nothing in it yet)</li>
</ul>
