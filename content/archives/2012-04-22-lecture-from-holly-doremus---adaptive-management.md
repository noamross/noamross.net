*[Holly Doremus, J.D.,
Ph.D.](http://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/faculty/facultyProfile.php?facID=5068),
visited Davis on 4/20/2012 as part of a seminar series on interfaces
between ecology, economics and policy. Dr. Doremus is at the UC Berkeley
School of Law, but has Ph.D. in Plant Physiology from Cornell. She is
former former UCD Faculty.*

misrepresentations are my own.*

Adaptive Management -- Knowing When to Say When
-----------------------------------------------

Adaptive management is thought of as a solution to two problems:

-   The *science problem* - What do we know and what can we learn about
    managed systems and the consequences of our actions?

-   The *policy problem* - Given what we know and we don't know, what
    should we do?

It has some potential downsides, though:

-   *Confusion over definitions and goals* - People ascribe different
    meanings to the term, and it becomes more symbolic than a way to
    confront the difficult parts of their job. (Sounds a lot like
    resilience to me)
-   *Resource demands and extended controversy* - It requires more time
    and effort by the agency. More constant monitoring, modification of
    decisions. This can have political and morale/psychological costs.
-   *Short-term/long-term trade-offs* - Learning may have to be put
    ahead of what might be the optimal short-term decision
-   *Accountability versus flexibility* - Agencies do not necessarily
    respond to the public interests, but respond to political and other
    pressures. Accountability mechanisms are needed to get agencies to
    use adaptive management in ways that are in the public interest.

The last of these is a *principal agent* problem. The objectives of an
agency will differ from those of the principal (legislatures, the
public), and there need to be ways to force alignment. For instance,
lawsuits to enforce the Endangered Species Act are such mechanisms.

Much of this arises when agencies are given multiple goals that have
trade-offs among them. For instance, the public lands agencies are told
to manage lands for multiple uses so as to best meet the public
interest, and all accountability is through the political process.

Adaptive management is becoming the *de facto* standard for natural
resource management, but when it's legislated or prescribed, there is
little conversation as to what it actually means, whether it is the best
strategy, and whether the value of learning outweighs the costs.

Courts rarely interfere with scientific decisions and agencies. This is,
in part, because lawyers and judges are culturally averse to scientific
topics. It is also because of the belief that legislatures have created
these agencies so as to outsource technical decisions.

### Is adaptive management the right choice?

1.  *Is action inevitable or essential, and why?*

    Is it feasible to delay action? Adapive management should not be
    used to justify ill-considered action. For instance, agencies can
    grant a take permit under the ESA, which normally requires proof
    that there would not be harm. Adaptive management can be used as an
    excuse to provide such a permit without proof.

    This may not apply if some action *is* inevitable but several
    options may be available. For instance, salvage logging may be
    better or worse that the risk of large fires for old-growth forests.
    Adaptive management might be a good tool here.

    Of course "inevitability" may be *political*.

2.  *What are the information gaps, and what difference will filling
    them make to management?*

    Articulate a model of the system, including uncertainties, goals,
    and metrics. Distinguish genuine unknowns from information that just
    isn't shared. Often there is information that is in the hands of
    landowners, etc., which might be demanded, but adaptive management
    is used as an excuse to avoid doing so.

3.  *How likely is significant learning, on what time frame, and at what
    cost?*

    Need to be honest about what experimentation is feasible and likely
    to be politically palatable. What information will it provide? What
    information can be gained from other approaches (modeling,
    observational science)?

4.  *Can management be adjusted as new information becomes available?*

    Will impacts be irreversible? How "sticky" are policy decisions,
    legally or politically? Can decisions be made incrementally?

    Adaptive management has part of its premise that policy choices are
    iterative. However, some decisions are irreversible. Because of
    pressure to make policy decisions as *final*, many decisions are
    effectively irreversible, and no action is a better choice.

### The value of explicit analysis

Rarely are the questions above answered in real management situations.
They ought to be, because it will help to:

-   Clarify goals
-   Help combat hubris and the tendency toward over-optimistic
    assumptions
-   Increase accountability
-   Inform budget decisions and frame expectations
-   Highlight removable barriers to learning

NEPA and other legislation requiring explicit analysis of impacts have
been useful; adaptive management should not be allowed to erode such
approaches.

### Tailor the strategy to the problem

Where goals are multiple and potentially conflicting, adaptive
management is likely to be abused (e.g., the "co-equal goals" of the
Delta Stewardship Council). Priorities and approaches to making
trade-offs must be defined first.

### Ensure accountability and enforceability

-   *Define triggers and responses* - before taking action
-   *Allow citizen enforcement* - e.g., lawsuits. This can can actually
    give agencies *cover* for politically difficult decisions.

### Reducing barriers to learning

-   *Find substitues or mitigators for risky experiments*
-   *Take advantage of "natural experiments"*
-   *Remove budget disincentives* - in the USFS and other agencies, the
    management and research budgets are distinct, which hampers learning
-   *Facilitate information sharing and diffusion*

### Promote systematic learning

-   Make models explicit
-   Build in systematic monitoring
-   *Recognize that data is not knowledge* - Monitoring alone just
    generates data that sits on a shelf. Monitoring plans must include a
    plan to analyze, disseminate, and act on findings.
-   Create positive career incentives.
