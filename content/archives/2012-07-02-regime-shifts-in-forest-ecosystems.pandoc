As I begin to put together material for my thesis proposal, I'm
collecting literature on regime shifts in forest ecosystems. I'm
interested in the time scale of regime shifts, and how they compare with
the time scale of stand dynamics (typically decades), which are the
dominant time scale in forestry economics.

Here is a preliminary set of examples and citations. I've also created a
[Mendeley
group](http://www.mendeley.com/groups/2356851/regime-shifts-in-forest-ecosystems/)
with the papers I'm collecting for this topic. What other examples do
people know of? Leave your thoughts in the comments!

Pests and Disease
-----------------

### Spruce budworm

Ludwig et al. (1978) modeled outbreaks of the spruce budworm, which
occur every several decades and result in large-scale forest mortality.
Budworm populations slowly increase as the forest matures and provides
greater resources. Periods of warm dry weather can result in budworm
numbers large enough to escape the predation of birds, and then large
outbreaks occur. More on this at the [Resilience
Alliance](http://www.resalliance.org/217.php)

### Bark beetles

Raffa et al. (2008) has a pretty good overview of threshold processes
involved in bark beetle outbreaks. One of the key threshold processes
that results in regime shift is the interaction between host physiology
and beetle aggregation (Berryman et al. 1984). Nelson and Lewis (2008)
was able to determine this threshold through explicit modeling of tree
physiology. See also Okland and Bjø rnstad (2006).

### Sudden oak death

Sudden oak death, caused by the water mold *Phytophthora ramorum*, may
exhibit a host-density threshold in its dynamics. When tanoak hosts
(*Notholithocarpus densiflorus*), exceed a critical density (\~8% of
stems), outbreak may occur and result in elimination of tanoak (Cobb et
al. 2012).

Drought in piñon forests
------------------------

Positive feedbacks between drought stress and bark beetle populations
(McDowell 2011) can lead to sudden piñon die-offs following periods of
drought, which can result in long-term shifts in forest composition.
Allen and Breshears (1998) documented drought-induced shifts from
ponderosa forest to piñon-juniper woodland in the great basin area, and
similar shifts from piñon to juniper have occurred following the
2002-2003 drought (Mueller et al. 2005, Breshears et al. 2005).

Forest-grassland transitions
----------------------------

### Forest and savanna as alternative stable states

There's lots of literature about the feedbacks that maintain savannas
and control the forest-savanna ecotone and evidence that they represent
alternative stable states (Sternberg 2001). Staver et al. (2011) and
Staver and Levin (2012) show empirical and modeling evidence that, in
areas with medium levels of precipitation, forest and savanna are
alternative regimes maintained by fire feedbacks. Fire spreads over open
grassy areas, so fire areas with greater grass cover suppresses tree
regeneration, while fire is less likely to spread over a critical
density of forested area. (See also Baudena and Rietkerk (2012).)

### North American forest-prairie transition:

As the North American glaciers retreated \~8000 years ago, some areas
appear to have responded to the gradual shift in climate with rapid
transitions from forest to prairie, as documented by Williams (2009,
2010, 2011).

Logging Fire Regime changes
---------------------------

Lindenmayer et al. (2011) describe positive feedbacks in mountain ash
Forests of Southeastern Australia, where younger forest burns at much
greater severity than older forest. Increased disturbance frequency due
to logging has resulted in more of these young stands, and greater
landscape connectivity between them, resulting in a regime shift to more
frequent fires. The authors call this landscape-scale socio-ecological
regime shift a "landscape trap".

Ribbon Forests
--------------

Rietkerk and van de Koppel (2008) review work by Hiemstra (2002, 2006)
on "ribbon forests" in Wyoming, where alternate forested and
non-forested areas form because snow accumulates more in non-forested
areas, killing seedlings.

### P availability and soil degradation

Lawrence et al. (2007) describe alternative stable states in tropical
forest due to P limitation. Mature primary forest traps dust-borne P in
the canopy and has lower leaching losses than secondary forest.
Deforestation, cultivation, and fallow reduces soil P and replaces
primary forest with secondary, resulting in long-term P declines.

Plant physiology
----------------

This is on a much smaller scale, but there's hysteresis in the
pressure-transport relationship in woody plant xylem (Sperry et al.
2002)
