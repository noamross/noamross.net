Lauren Yamane talked about Andersen et al. (2004) in our Ecological
Stoichiometry course today. Here are her slides, and below, my rough
notes on the paper:

Notes on the Paper
------------------

-   Stoichiometry is a way of representing food quality - there is
    evidence that consumers have preference for high quality (e.g., low
    C:N) food.
-   There is often a mismatch between composition of prey (autotrophs)
    and needs of consumers. Autotrophs have variable C:N ratios,
    consumers are more constrained.
    -   This mismatch affects carbon transfer efficiency

-   Food quality can drive population fluctuations

### Biological Basis

-   N and P driven by needs of protein and RNA
-   The **growth rate hypothesis** states that high P-content in
    organisms that are
-   Among plants there is much more flexibility, but also lower relative
    N and P requirements
-   Heterotrophs have CNP ratios an order of magnitude below autotrophs
-   Differences between autotrophs and heterotrophs are limiting but
    also drive nutrient cycling and release
-   Threshold element ratio (TER) is the critical ratio where limitation
    shifts from C/energy to another element. However above this,
    transfer efficiency decreases as consumers need to excrete extra
    nutrients.
-   Nutrient requirements vary throughout development. Some stages may
    be more limiting.

### Density Dependence

-   Density dependence of food quality could be positive or negative
    -   Grazing of plants may lead to density dependence via quality
        reduction due to either selective grazing of choice nutrients or
        induced plant defenses.
    -   Alternatively, grazers can mobilize nutrients otherwise
        difficult for other organisms to acquire, speed up cycling due
        to lower plant biomass under same nutrient inputs
    -   Chemostat experiments with *Daphnia* have confirmed the latter
        effect

-   In elaborations on L-V models[^1], including nutrient limitation
    bounds the possible regions of predator-prey phase space. The
    constraint stabilizes the system.
-   Nutrient limitation implies that growth is limited by populations of
    all species in the system
-   The effect of nutrient on dynamics is limited to
    nutrient-constrained systems.

*Idea - stoichiometry is a great mechanism for looking at seasonal and
transient effects*
