[Jordi Bascompte](http://bascompte.net/) gave a [Storer
Lecture](http://bioscinet.ucdavis.edu/Events/Events/Storer) at UC Davis
on November 15, 2012. Here are my rough notes:

-   Biodiversity as the set of interactions *between* species, rather
    than accounting of species
-   Most research in mutualism in evolution focus on bilateral
    interactions (e.g., Darwin's orchids and moths)
-   Jordi's goal is to use network theory to represent mutualism in
    ecological communities and generalize about them. Three

-   Using data sets on man mutualistic communities (pollinators,
    frugivores),

    1.  Describe network archiecture
    2.  Examine robustness against extinctions, and relationship of
        network to species richness
    3.  Examine the contribution of individual species to network
        architecture and robustness

Major results
-------------

-   Networks tend to have *nested* architectures (Bascompte et al. 2003)
-   Nested structures are more robust to species extinctions, *if*
    specialists have greater risk of extinction (Memmott et al. 2004)
-   Phylogeny predicts a lot of mutualistic network structure. As a
    result, network-driven extinction patterns tend to cluster on the
    phylogenetic tree, causing a greater loss of taxonomic diversity
    than would occur in a random network (Rezende et al. 2007)
-   Theoretical result: nested networks have lower effective
    interspecific competition, allowing higher maximum biodiversity
    (Bastolla et al. 2009)
-   There's a wide range of the extent that plants actually contribute
    to the nested network architecture. However those that contribute
    heavily to nestedness have a higher probability of going extinct.
    Economic systems can be described in similar ways, and you get the
    same results for designers and contractors in industry (Saavedra et
    al. 2011). However, the mechanism driving this pattern is not known
    - is it general to nested networks, or a consequence of how these
    networks have evolved

*Idea*: you could compare randomly generated networks to real or
simulated phylogenetically ones, and see the strength of the
contribution-vulnerability trade-off

Aside: When you look at strength of network interactions, you see a
similar pattern of asymmetry and nestedness in networks.
