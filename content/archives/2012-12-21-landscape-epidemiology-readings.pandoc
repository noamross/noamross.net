Here's the first of my quals reading summaries, this landscape forest
pathology. [David Rizzo](http://ucanr.org/sites/rizzolab/) will be
examining me on this topic.

Summary
-------

Much of our knowledge of pathology is at the organismal level
(host-pathogen interactions), but actual management occurs at stand,
forest, and regional levels. To understand and manage forest diseases at
this scale, we need appropriate epidemiological and landscape ecology
tools and frameworks.

Gilbert and Hubbell (1996) discusses the differences between
traditional, agriculturally-focused plant pathology and pathology at the
forest community level, with conservation management goals. In these
communities, diseases are a normal part of the community, but the
authors distinguish between *endemic* diseases, which are an important
part of the ecosystem, and *epidemic* diseases, which are short-term,
often malignant disturbances. They note that epidemics are rarely
regular parts of forest dynamics, but are often due to human
intervention, be it introduction of disease or modification. They can
also occur in response to stochastic climate events.

Modifications that trigger epidemics may include homogenization of
ecosystems or surrounding agricultural systems, introduction or
enhancement of disease vectors, or modifying community composition.
Since composition, spatial structure, genetic and species diversity all
regulate endemic disease, it has the potential to become epidemic as
these things change.

However the distinction between endemic and epidemic isn't so clear,
because forest systems are not static and rarely in anything like a
dynamic equilibrium., which is what Gilbert and Hubbell (1996)'s
conception of "endemic" disease seems to be. The case of the root rot
*Phellinus weirri*, as described by Hansen and Goheen (2000)
demonstrates this. *P. weirri* spreads through root systems in slowly
exapanding centers, or genets, which can grow for hundreds or thousands
of years. Within these genets, disease-resistant trees form community
structures different from the disease-free matrix, but even within the
genets community structures vary along a cline from the edge to the
center. Succession occurs within the genet, but also in response to fire
and wind events, and the result is a complex community and spatial
structure to the forest which never reaches a "climax" community.
Instead, the system is constantly in flux, and the community composition
is a result of legacy/stochastic events and the interaction of many
processes (genet spread, tree growth, tree competition). The relative
rates of these processes are important in structuring the community.

The complexity of these large-scale processes require a landscape
perspective, which both Holdenrieder et al. (2004) and Meentemeyer et
al. (2012) advocate. Holdenrieder et al. (2004) focus on the importance
of landscape heterogeneity on disease spread. Heterogeneity in
environment, patterns of dispersal, host availability and genetic
composition are all important in understanding how pathogens move
through populations. Meentemeyer et al. (2012) expand on this in a few
key areas: First, the importance of a *dynamic* perspective that
examines feedbacks between landscape ecological processes and disease,
based on expansions of the SIR framework. Secondly, a *multi-scale*
perspective that examines processes at different spatial scales, and
matches the scales of process, observation, analysis and management.
Just as important are matching the data collected to the process
analyzed, and proxies for landscape processes (e.g., climate proxies, or
proxies for dispersal distance). Meentemeyer et al. (2012) also discuss
different approaches to modeling and analysis for both inference and
prediction, noting that these goals result not only in different
modeling approaches, but also the type and scale of data collected.

[Gilbert and Hubbell (1996) - Plant Diseases and the Conservation of Tropical Forests](#TOC)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Summary / Key Points](#TOC)
----------------------------

-   Diseases regulate plant community structure, function, and evolution
-   Diverse, endemic pathogens are common, but human intervention,
    disturbance, and climate events incite short-term epidemics with
    long-term recovery, if any.
-   Intervention is required at different scales (plant wounding,
    fragmentation, community restructuring) to incite epidemics
-   Plant spatial structure, genetic and species diversity effect the
    ability of disease to disperse and take hold
-   Fragmentation can leave forest vulnerable to disease due to small
    population sizes, lower diversity, and edge and interaction effects
    with agriculture (exposure to new diseases, adjacent monocultures)
-   Reserve design needs to consider the spatial spread mechanisms of
    disease and its interaction with the surrounding habitat matrix

### [Factors influencing disease development](#TOC)

-   Epidemics are typically bad for conservation, but endemics may be
    essenial
-   Disease requires pathogen, host and favorable environment
-   Endemics are common, but epidemics tend to result from human
    intervention (introduction of pathogens or stressors, community
    modification) or climatic events.
-   Similar framework to invasives/pests
-   Host density is important to disease, but so is *heterogeneity of
    pathogen reproduction and dispersal rates*, which help the pathogen
    spread at multiple scales.
-   Logging can increase spread of stump-infecting fungi (*Armillaria*,
    *Heterobasidion*)
-   Many pathogens require wounds, usually from herbivores or humans, to
    successfully infect trees
-   Plantations are vulnerable to disease due to host density and
    homogeneity
-   Dieback diseases can often be attributed to drought
-   Many diseases are associated with **forest decline** - a mix of
    biotic and abiotic factors (pollution, drought, poor soil)

### [Direct negative effects of disease](#TOC)

-   Negative effects of epidemics may last a long time (decades) because
    of long-term effects on reproduction and growth, and the retention
    of pathogens as saprophytes.
-   Disease that targets sub-populations (genetic, age cohorts), can
    re-structure the population, reduce genetic diversity
-   Small populations are vulnerable to disease due to combination of
    low diversity and stochastic population reductions

### [Direct positive effects of disease](#TOC)

-   Diseases create disturbances, gaps, and micro-habitat (e.g., holes
    in trees) important for diversity.
-   Promotes diversity through Janzen-Connel mechansism (greater
    survival of further dispersing organisms)
-   Diseases are generally more harmful on local genotypes, esp. in
    tropics, where leaves are long-lived.
-   Disease modify competetive dynamics, (e.g., root rot *Phellinus
    weirii* favor Pacific fur over otherwise dominant hemlock.)

### [Density and Dominance](#TOC)

-   Small and homogenous populations of trees have less diverse
    pathogens, and are also more vulnerable.
-   Loss of dispersers may leave trees vulnerable due to high local
    densities
-   High diversity may reduce disease spread in the case of
    species-specific diseases, but not in the case of more general
    diseases

### [Interactions with agriculture](#TOC)

-   Natural ecosystems ar reservoirs for agricultural pests, but natural
    fragments in agricultural landscapes can be vulnerable to epidemics
    that begin in agricultural monocultures, or to introductions from
    agricultura/horticultural imports.
    -   This may be especially to for heteroecious rusts, which require
        two hosts to complete the life cycle. Ag/wild interfaces may
        promote the disease.

-   Agricultural disease may lead to rapid deforestation as farmers look
    for "uncontaminated lands"

### [Disease and reserve design](#TOC)

-   Recovery is usually much longer than epidemic length
-   Dividing reserves into small parts may provide some protection due
    to transmission barriers.
-   However, agricultural/edge effects may make larger reserves
    preferable

[Hansen and Goheen (2000) - Root Pathogen Control of Forest Structure](#TOC)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Summary / Key points](#TOC)
----------------------------

-   Root-rot diseases are important in structuring forest communities
-   They are very common in Western North American forests
-   The way a disease structures a forest is influenced by how it
    affects different hosts, its rate and mode of spread, spatial scale,
    and how it dies out.
-   The relative rates of infection, mortality, and regeneration are
    important in the structure, as well
-   Root disease and stand dynamics take place over very long periods. A
    forest is likely never in an equilibrium in terms of root/soil
    pathogens.
-   Root pathogens generate a distinct patchiness in communities
-   Individual variation in vulnerability is NOT neccessary to generate
    the clinal patterns at the edge of disease patches
-   As stands age, multi-disease interactions become more important and
    the total disease burden can accumulate so as to radically change
    the community, but events like fire can reset this pattern.

### [Introduction](#TOC)

-   Pathogens provide essential functions to forests, but much
    understanding of them has been in the framework of disease as a pest
    in decay-free plantation forestry
-   Native, endemic pathogens can kill even healthy trees
-   *Phellinus weirri* acts as a disturbance agent, killing trees and
    creating expanding gaps.

### [System: Northwestern Coniferous Forest](#TOC)

-   In Douglas-fir forest, succession is reset by fire and
    clear-cutting. Diversity increases rapidly in early years, then
    decreases as Douglas fir grows and shades the understory.
    Shade-tolerant trees (hemlock) establish in the understory and only
    grow to the canopy when long-lived Douglas-fir is disturbed.

### [*Phellinus weirri*](#TOC)

-   Agent of root rot, damaging to timber Douglas-fir forests
-   Wide host range in conifers, but motly harms Douglas-fir, mountain
    hemlock, and grand/white fir. Some species infected but not harmed.
    Hardwoods immune.
-   Spreads via roots via mycelia, initiates xylem decay. Trees topple
    from weak root networks even if they still have healthy crowns.
-   Mortality front moves \~30cm/yr, unevenly
-   3 distinct subspecies
-   Many independent centers/"genets" in a forest. Each grows slowly,
    lasts 100s-1000s of years, slows when it loses contact with
    vulnerable species.
-   Genets die in center of mortality after hosts are all dead, and
    after fires. Effectively, they break up.

### [Effects on Forests](#TOC)

-   Regenerating Douglas-fir forests have gaps where genets are
-   Infection covers 12-80% of Doug-fir forests
-   Mortality impact is enhanced by interaction with wind, beetles. Wind
    topples, beetles infest infected trees
-   As stands age, infected forest become increasingly uneven-aged. More
    structural diversity
-   In *mountain* hemlock forests, hemlock is killed but continuously
    regenerates and dies in genets, creating a unique community
    structure with resistant pines
-   In Douglas-fir, forests, shade-tolerant, resistant trees (*western*
    hemlock\*) form dense canopies behind the mortality front. In
    forests without resistant trees, high-light shrub areas form
-   These dense areas may be more likely to have stand-replacing fires,
    which hav varying successional processes afterwards
-   These patches attract specific animal communities
-   Decomposition and nutrient availability increases behind the
    mortality front, but there is a lag (\~10 ft / 30 yrs) before the
    soil is hospitable to new seedlings
-   The center has abundant woody depbris and decomposer species

### [Effect of tree vigor](#TOC)

-   Old hypothesis: The first vulnerable trees establishing behind the
    mortality front are more vigorous due to increased nutrients and are
    less susceptible to infection
-   New hypothesis: These trees are also vulnerable, but they die small
    so disease spread is limited

### [Old growth forests](#TOC)

-   Many of the strucutural characteristics of old-growth forests are
    due to rot pathogens, which enhance horizontal and vertical
    structural diversity
-   Stem rots are also endemic to such forests, and important in causing
    mortality and providing stem habitat for animals
-   Dwarf mistletoes are common in older, complex stands.
-   In concert, these pathogens can dramatically alter species
    composition and reduce biomass.
-   Stands with fire history have less of this disease-driven decline

### [Managed forests](#TOC)

-   Human intervention has driven an increase in Douglas-fir and other
    vulneratble species, and thus an increase in *P. weirii*
-   Stump-cutting increases the infection rate.
-   Forest management plans do not adequately consider the effects and
    causes of disease

### [Modeling](#TOC)

-   The Western Rood Disease Model is an extension to FVS which can be
    used in forest planning
-   But data on disease prevalance is scarce, and interaction of
    pathogens isn't get modled.

[Holdenrieder et al. (2004): Landscape pathology](#TOC)
-------------------------------------------------------

### [Summary / Key Points](#TOC)

-   Large-scale spatial perspectives are important in studying forest
    disease
-   At these scales, landscape heterogeneity, species composition, and
    host/pathogen genetics vary across space. Land-use and infection
    legacies also important
-   When considering conservation, balance between connectivity and
    fragmentation depends on their relative effects on host/pathogen
    growth
-   Look at Park et al. (2002) for spatial influences on epidemics

### [Introduction](#TOC)

-   Diseases can affect landscape structure and vice versa (e.g.,
    landslides after tree mortality)
-   Many disease outbreaks occur at regional scales
-   Important to study disease at large scales to understand it
-   Epidemiological and landscape tools have recently been used to deal
    with these large-scale studies

### [Fragmentation](#TOC)

-   Fragmentation *may* limit disease spread, but it has complex effects
    on host, reservoir, and pathogen populations.
-   Fragmentation may hinder host migration, resulting in greater
    vulnerability due to altered environmental conditions and reduced
    genetic resources
-   Pathogens can spread through corridors - relative rates important
-   Fusiform rust *Cronartium quercuum* has been shown to increase in
    more interconnected landscapes
-   Connectivity can come from placement of fragments (*Cronartium
    quercuum*), or transfer of propogules on vehicles (in root pathogen
    *Phytophthora lateralis*)

### [Predisposing environmental features](#TOC)

-   Site-specific variables such as climate, slope, soil properties,
    etc. effect disease incidence and virulence, but the scale of
    measurement is important

### [Host and pathogen landscape patterns](#TOC)

-   (Alternate) host availability may be more important than
    environmental factors in predicting arrival of pathogen
-   Historical factors, such as previous species composition or history
    of infection, have an effect because of residual disease reservoirs
-   Landscape patterns of both host and pathogen genetic variation may
    be important, as in the case of *Armillaria* root rot genets.

### [Landscape perspectives on Sudden Oak Death](#TOC)

-   Research found clustering patterns between 100 and 300 m
-   Occurrence at all slope positions helped suggest the wind-blown rain
    transmission mechanism.
-   Forest edge effects suggest imoprtance of understory foliar hosts
    that prefer high-light environments

[Meentemeyer et al. (2004) - Landscape Epidemiology of Emerging Infectious Disease](#TOC)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Summary / Key Points](#TOC)

-   Landscape epidemiology examines disease processes at large spatial
    scales, considering heterogeneity, connectivity, and other
    large-scale patterns and processes
-   Most diseases have processes that occur at multiple spatial scales -
    study that considers multiple scales and their interaction are
    important
-   Spread and the endemic/epidemic gradient are in part scale-dependent
-   Study design has to consider the scales of process, observation,
    analysis and management, as well as the analytical goals.
-   Direct observations are often more useful than proxies. Also direct
    consideration of spatial processes (dispersal) rather than proxies
    like distance.
-   Parsimony/complexity trade-offs must consisder data availability and
    management goals, as well.

### [Introduction](#TOC)

-   Disease occurs in a complex spatiotemporal landscape with
    heterogeneity in environments and dispersal mechanisms
-   Temporal components of landscapes require modeling tools beyond GIS
-   Most landscape epidemiology research is observational rather than
    model- or experiment-based. Multiscale approaches are rare

### [Key considerations in landscape-level analysis](#TOC)

-   Appropriate spatial scale: Corridors are important for vector-borne,
    but not wind-borne diseases
-   Geographic disequilibrium - classification of emerging, invasice,
    and endemic depend on scale of analsysis
-   Consider scale in the infectious process, the level of the data, and
    the analytical scale. Mismatches can lead to poor inference
-   Static vs. dynamic analysis. Logit models of disease incidence do
    not help predict future behavior. SIR models are dynamic, but
    require considerably more complexity to include landscape
    information.
-   Spatially implicit or explicit? Can be implicit when only
    environmental heterogeneity is considered, but impicity when there
    is interaction among location in process.
-   Predictor variables: Many are indirect (e.g., slope), rather than
    direct measures of factors influencing process. Similarly, consider
    spatial connectivity statistics and proxies, and how thy relate to
    dispersal ability, etc.
-   Inference or prediction? Parsimony and predictivity important in
    model, but for application must consider whether predictive
    variables will be available for management. Also, difference between
    actual and potential disease distribution - ecological theory
    important here.

### [Analytical Frontiers](#TOC)

-   Multiscale analysis - ecosystems and epidemiological processes have
    spatial hierarchies.
-   Some processes, like power-law dispersal, can be scale-invariant.
    But many lead to different patterns and processes at different
    scales.
-   Multi-scale analysis helps avoid scaling-up problems. Approaches
    include nested sampling and analysis, inclusion of spatial
    dependent-autocorrelation in prediction
-   Landscape connectivity - Ellis et al. (2010) use a "least cost
    friction" approach to determine the importance of connectivity
    relative to environtal variables in transmission between patches
    (for SOD)
-   Examining connectivity at different scales with multiple
    transmission mechanisms
-   Graph theory to analyze connectivity
-   Optimal disease control with landscape dynamics: Using landscape
    models to explore possible control scenarios

### [What's next](#TOC)

-   Interacting disturbances - e.g., logging/disease/fire
-   Reciprical socio-ecological feedbacks
