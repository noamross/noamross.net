My first peer-reviewed publication is an encyclopedia article written
with colleagues in economics in UC Davis:

> ### [Economics and Ecology of Open-Access Fisheries](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-375067-9.00114-5)
>
> K. Fuller, D. Kling, K. Kroetz, N. Ross and J.N. Sanchirico (2013)
>
> In: Shogren, J.F., (ed.) Encyclopedia of Energy, Natural Resource, and
> Environmental Economics, Vol. 2 *Encyclopedia of Energy, Natural
> Resource, and Environmental Economics* p.39-49. Amsterdam: Elsevier.

> #### Abstract
>
> In open-access fisheries, participation and harvest by fishermen are
> unregulated. Under these conditions, the amount of fishing is greater
> than the socially optimal level, the economic profits from fishing are
> dissipated, and fish stocks are depleted and can even be driven to
> extinction. A large body of theoretical and empirical research has
> demonstrated the robustness of these results.
>
> Although the basic outcomes hold across a variety of systems, the
> behavior of an open-access fishery can be complex. Simple models of
> fish ecology coupled with harvester behavior can explain boom-and-bust
> cycles in a fishery and fishing communities and complex supply
> responses. More complex ecological models of open-access fisheries
> illustrate the interactions among fishing, fish populations, and other
> parts of the ecosystem, as well as explain why some fishing
> regulations produce unintended consequences. Studying open access
> provides a foundation for understanding fishery economics, a baseline
> from which to measure the gains of implementing fishing regulations,
> and lends insight to the design of better regulatory systems.

The process of writing this article was interesting. Two years ago, when
I was a first-year graduate student, my economics advisor [Jim
Sanchirico](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Sanchirico/) began
convening lab meetings. This isn't common practice among economists as
far as I know, and we were trying to figure out how to use the meetings
constructively. Around the same time, Jim received a request to write a
few articles for this encyclopedia, and we figured it would be a good
exercise to read the original literature on this subject and write the
articles together.

This was a great chance for me. I had zero exposure to the natural
resource economics literature and wouldn't get around to courses in it
for another year. Also, as a first-year ecology grad student working
with a group of more experienced economists, I was a pretty good proxy
for the target audience of outsiders to the field. So I got play the
role of naive reader, asking for clearer explanations and less jargon
from my co-authors. I also wrote some of the introductory and ecological
sections.

I'm grateful to Jim for putting me on board this project, and for the
chance to work with great colleagues in a different field, but I
probably won't do something similar again. I don't support the
publication model. Ironically, while the article is about "Open-Access
Fisheries," it is about as far from an open-access publication as can
be. It's in a
[\$1500](http://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Natural-Resource-Environmental-Economics/dp/0123750679)
encyclopedia published by *Elsevier*. We received a very small
honorarium[^1], and Elsevier will reap profits by selling access to this
encyclopedia to libraries as part of some overpriced bundle. I'd rather
spend my taxpayer-funded fellowship creating resources available to all.

[^1]: If that's what it is called. The arrangement was, I think, one or
    two hundred dollars per article, which the lab was supposed to split
    for dinner and beer. Still waiting on that part, Jim.
