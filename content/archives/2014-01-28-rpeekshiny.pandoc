Yesterday at the [Davis R User's
Group](http://www.noamross.net/davis-r-users-group.html)[^1], [Ryan
Peek](https://watershed.ucdavis.edu/people/rapeek?destination=user/71)
gave a talk about using the `shiny` package to create interactive web
apps with R. Here are his slides. Ryan includes a bunch of links to
examples and tutorials, as well as his own [thermohydrographs
app](http://aquapeek.shinyapps.io/thermohydrographs/):
