Last Fr [Davis R Users' Group](http://www.noamross.net/davis-r-users-group.html), [Jaime Ashander](http://www.ashander.info/posts/2015/04/D-RUG-mixed-effects-viz/) gave a presentation on and visualizing and diagnosing (G)LMMs in R.  Here's the video:

Jaime also wrote up the notes from his talk, including all the code, on his blog [here](http://www.ashander.info/posts/2015/04/D-RUG-mixed-effects-viz/) (with the raw R Markdown file on github [here](https://github.com/ashander/ashander.github.io/blob/content/content/notes/mixedeffects_viz.Rmd)). The material in the blog post is expanded and improved upon from the original talk, though this means the video and posted code don't match exactly.
