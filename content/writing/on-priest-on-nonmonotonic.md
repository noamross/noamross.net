Graham Priest defends the use of a nonmonotonic logic, _LPm_, in his analysis of reasoning in the face of true contradictions, such as those arising from the paradoxes of self-reference. In the course of defending the choice of this logic in the face of the criticism that _LPm_ is not truth preserving, Priest argued that requirement is too much to ask: since _LPm_ is a nonmonotonic logic, it necessarily fails to preserve truth. In this paper, I show that this assumption is incorrect, and I explain why nonmonotonic logics can nonetheless be truth preserving. Finally, I diagnose Priest's error, to explain when nonmonotonic logics do indeed fail to preserve truth.

Graham Priest has written a [very short reply](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tht3.204) to this article, which also appears in *Thought*.
